If the Driver Support Unit (DSU) is disconnected, openpilot ACC will replace stock ACC. NOTE: disconnecting the DSU disables Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB). 3 Refers only to the Focus Mk4 (C519) available in Europe/China/Taiwan/Australasia, not the Focus Mk3 (C346) in North and South America/Southeast Asia. 4 See more setup details for GM . 5 2019 Honda Civic 1.6L Diesel Sedan does not have ALC below 12mph. 6 Requires a CAN FD panda kit if not using comma 3X for this CAN FD car . 7 See more setup details for Nissan . 8 In the non-US market, openpilot requires the car to come equipped with EyeSight with Lane Keep Assistance. 9 Enabling longitudinal control (alpha) will disable all EyeSight functionality, including AEB, LDW, and RAB. 10 Some 2023 model years have HW4. To check which hardware type your vehicle has, look for Autopilot computer under Software -> Additional Vehicle Information on your vehicle's touchscreen. See this page for more information. 11 See more setup details for Tesla . 12 openpilot operates above 28mph for Camry 4CYL L, 4CYL LE and 4CYL SE which don't have Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. 13 Not including the China market Kamiq, which is based on the (currently) unsupported PQ34 platform. 14 Refers only to the MQB-based European B8 Passat, not the NMS Passat in the USA/China/Mideast markets. 15 Some \u0160koda vehicles are equipped with heated windshields, which are known to block GPS signal needed for some comma 3X functionality. 16 Only available for vehicles using a gateway (J533) harness. At this time, vehicles using a camera harness are limited to using stock ACC. 17 Model-years 2022 and beyond may have a combined CAN gateway and BCM, which is supported by openpilot in software, but doesn't yet have a harness available from the comma store. Community Maintained Cars Although they're not upstream, the community has openpilot running on other makes and models. See the 'Community Supported Models' section of each make on our wiki . Don't see your car here? openpilot can support many more cars than it currently does. There are a few reasons your car may not be supported. If your car doesn't fit into any of the incompatibility criteria here, then there's a good chance it can be supported! We're adding support for new cars all the time. We don't have a roadmap for car support , and in fact, most car support comes from users like you! Which cars are able to be supported? openpilot uses the existing steering, gas, and brake interfaces in your car. If your car lacks any one of these interfaces, openpilot will not be able to control the car. If your car has ACC and any form of LKAS / LCA , then it almost certainly has these interfaces. These features generally started shipping on cars around 2016. Note that manufacturers will often make their own marketing terms for these features, such as Hyundai's \"Smart Cruise Control\" branding of Adaptive Cruise Control. If your car has the following packages or features, then it's a good candidate for support. Make Required Package/Features Acura Any car with AcuraWatch Plus will work. AcuraWatch Plus comes standard on many newer models. Ford Any car with Lane Centering will likely work. Honda Any car with Honda Sensing will work. Honda Sensing comes standard on many newer models. Subaru Any car with EyeSight will work. EyeSight comes standard on many newer models. Nissan Any car with ProPILOT will likely work. Toyota & Lexus Any car that has Toyota/Lexus Safety Sense with \"Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist (LDA w/SA)\" and/or \"Lane Tracing Assist (LTA)\" will work. Note that LDA without Steering Assist will not work. These features come standard on most newer models. Hyundai, Kia, & Genesis Any car with Smart Cruise Control (SCC) and Lane Following Assist (LFA) or Lane Keeping Assist (LKAS) will work. LKAS/LFA comes standard on most newer models. Any form of SCC will work, such as NSCC. Chrysler, Jeep, & Ram Any car with LaneSense and Adaptive Cruise Control will likely work. These come standard on many newer models. FlexRay All the cars that openpilot supports use a CAN bus for communication between all the car's computers, however a CAN bus isn't the only way that the computers in your car can communicate. Most, if not all, vehicles from the following manufacturers use FlexRay instead of a CAN bus: BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Land Rover, and some Volvo . These cars may one day be supported, but we have no immediate plans to support FlexRay. Toyota Security openpilot does not yet support these Toyota models due to a new message authentication method.
