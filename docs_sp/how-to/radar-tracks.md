**How Radar Points Can Be Used Along With Vision:**  
Current Openpilot policy is to identify with vision first and match it to a radar point. If vision sees nothing, you get a false negative and no lead car detection.

#### **Steps to Enable Radar Tracks:**
1. **Preparation**:  
   Ensure the car is in the `OFF` ignition position and connect your compatible comma device (EON, C2, C3) to the car.

2. **SSH Connection**:  
   Connect to your comma device via SSH. (Instructions [HERE](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/SSH))

3. **Execute Commands**:  
   In the SSH terminal, execute the following commands:
   ```bash
   pkill -f openpilot
   python /data/openpilot/selfdrive/debug/hyundai_enable_radar_points.py
   ```
   Follow the script instructions and ensure no faults appear.

4. **Reboot**:  
   Reboot your comma device and start your car ensuring no faults.

5. **Test Drive**:  
   Go for a quick drive, drive behind a lead car, and allow the drive to upload its `rlogs` in [comma Connect](https://connect.comma.ai).

6. **Verify in Cabana**:  
   Open the drive in Cabana from [comma Connect](https://connect.comma.ai), load `hyundai_kia_mando_front_radar.dbc`, search `RADAR_TRACK_50x`, and check `LONG_DIST`.

7. **Confirmation**:  
   If the radar tracks data is relevant, you've successfully enabled radar tracks.
